Executive Summary

This study presents Nigeria’s first integrated, GIS-based renewable energy suitability assessment combining solar, wind, and hydropower resources into a unified decision-support framework. Using satellite data and spatial multi-criteria analysis, the study identifies priority states and regions for renewable energy investment.


Key Findings

Northern states consistently rank highest for combined renewable potential

Solar and wind dominate national-scale suitability, with hydropower providing localized but strategic contributions

Zamfara, Sokoto, Katsina, and Yobe emerge as top-ranked states in the combined index


Policy Implications

Renewable energy planning should shift from single-resource targeting to integrated portfolio planning

State-level rankings enable phased investment strategies aligned with grid expansion

The combined index provides an objective basis for donor prioritization and project screening


Recommendations

Use combined renewable index for national planning and donor coordination

Integrate grid capacity and demand layers in future updates

Apply the framework to site-level feasibility screening


Use by Development Partners
