4. Discussion
4.1 Interpretation of Spatial Suitability Patterns

The results of this study confirm that renewable energy suitability in Nigeria is highly spatially differentiated, with distinct geographic patterns emerging for solar, wind, and hydropower resources. These patterns are consistent with Nigeria’s climatic gradients, hydrological systems, and topographic variability.

Solar suitability dominates across much of northern Nigeria, reflecting high annual solar irradiance and relatively low cloud cover. This widespread suitability suggests that solar energy represents the most universally scalable renewable resource in the country. Wind suitability, while also strongest in northern regions, exhibits a more selective spatial footprint, indicating that wind energy development should be pursued through targeted siting rather than blanket deployment.

Hydropower suitability shows the most constrained spatial distribution, driven primarily by river flow accumulation and terrain conditions. This reinforces the understanding that hydropower development in Nigeria is geographically limited and should be strategically concentrated in hydrologically favorable basins rather than evenly distributed across administrative units.

4.2 Implications of State-Level Rankings

The state-level renewable indices and rankings provide a policy-relevant abstraction of complex spatial data. States such as Zamfara, Sokoto, Katsina, Yobe, and Gombe rank highly in the combined index, largely due to strong solar and wind potential. Importantly, these states do not necessarily exhibit high suitability across all three resources, illustrating that high combined performance can emerge from strength in complementary resources rather than uniform dominance.

This finding highlights the value of hybrid renewable energy planning, where solar and wind systems can be co-located or integrated to enhance generation reliability and seasonal balancing. Conversely, states with comparatively stronger hydropower suitability but weaker solar or wind performance achieve moderate combined rankings, suggesting that hydropower may play a supporting or regional role rather than serving as the primary national renewable backbone.

4.3 Policy Relevance for Energy Planning and Investment

The combined renewable energy index developed in this study offers a practical decision-support tool for national and subnational energy planning. By translating raster-level suitability into state-scale indicators, the analysis aligns with Nigeria’s existing administrative and governance structures, facilitating integration into policy frameworks such as renewable energy targets, electrification strategies, and infrastructure investment plans.

For policymakers, the results suggest that:

Northern Nigeria is well suited for large-scale solar and wind deployment, including utility-scale plants and hybrid systems.

Central and southern regions present more localized opportunities, particularly for hydropower and mixed renewable portfolios.

Resource-specific planning is essential, as uniform national strategies may underperform when applied without spatial differentiation.

The rankings can support prioritization of grid expansion, renewable energy zones, and public–private investment incentives by identifying states where renewable deployment is likely to be most cost-effective.

4.4 Contribution to Renewable Energy Policy in Nigeria

This study contributes to Nigeria’s renewable energy discourse by providing a transparent, GIS-based, multi-resource assessment framework that complements existing national energy plans. Unlike single-resource assessments, the integrated approach captures the trade-offs and synergies between different renewable technologies.

The methodology aligns with principles outlined in Nigeria’s National Energy Master Plan by emphasizing spatial optimization, diversification of energy sources, and evidence-based planning. The combined index also supports regional equity considerations by identifying multiple pathways to renewable deployment rather than favoring a single technology or region.

4.5 Limitations and Uncertainty Considerations

Despite its strengths, the analysis is subject to several limitations. First, the suitability assessment is based on static, long-term average datasets, which may not fully capture seasonal variability or future climate change impacts. Second, the weighting scheme assumes equal or expert-defined importance across factors, which may differ under alternative policy priorities or economic constraints.

Additionally, the use of state-level aggregation can mask intra-state variability, particularly in geographically large or ecologically diverse states. As such, the rankings should be interpreted as strategic screening tools rather than site-specific development prescriptions.

4.6 Directions for Future Research

Future work could extend this framework by incorporating:

Techno-economic parameters such as levelized cost of energy (LCOE)

Climate change projections and resource variability

Grid capacity, demand centers, and storage suitability

Multi-criteria decision analysis with stakeholder-driven weighting

Such enhancements would further strengthen the model’s utility for investment-grade planning and long-term energy transition strategies.




5. Conclusions

This study presents an integrated GIS-based assessment of solar, wind, and hydropower suitability across Nigeria, combining spatial analysis with state-level aggregation to support strategic renewable energy planning. By applying a standardized preprocessing workflow, resource-specific suitability rules, and a normalized multi-criteria overlay model, the analysis provides a consistent and transparent framework for comparing renewable energy potential across regions.

The results demonstrate that renewable energy suitability in Nigeria is spatially heterogeneous, with solar energy exhibiting the widest geographic applicability, wind energy showing strong but regionally concentrated potential, and hydropower suitability being geographically constrained by hydrological and topographic factors. The combined renewable energy index highlights states in northern Nigeria as particularly favorable for large-scale renewable deployment, driven primarily by complementary solar and wind resources.

By translating raster-level suitability outputs into state-level indices and rankings, the study bridges the gap between spatial analysis and policy implementation. The combined index offers a practical decision-support tool for prioritizing investment, guiding grid expansion, and informing national and subnational renewable energy strategies. Importantly, the findings underscore the value of hybrid renewable energy systems and region-specific planning approaches rather than uniform national deployment models.

Despite these contributions, the analysis is subject to limitations related to data resolution, static climatic assumptions, weighting choices, and spatial aggregation. As such, the results should be interpreted as a strategic screening framework rather than a substitute for detailed site-level feasibility studies.

Overall, this study provides a replicable and extensible methodology that supports evidence-based renewable energy planning in Nigeria. The framework can be readily adapted to incorporate techno-economic factors, climate change scenarios, and stakeholder-driven weighting schemes, thereby strengthening its relevance for long-term energy transition planning and sustainable development policy.
