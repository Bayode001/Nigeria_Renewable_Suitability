Project Title

Integrated GIS-Based Renewable Energy Suitability Mapping for Nigeria

Background & Rationale

Nigeria faces persistent electricity supply gaps despite abundant renewable energy resources. Strategic deployment of solar, wind, and hydropower requires spatially explicit, data-driven decision support tools that integrate resource availability, terrain constraints, and infrastructure proximity.

Current planning approaches are often sector-specific and lack spatial integration across renewable technologies. This project addresses that gap by developing a national-scale, GIS-based renewable energy suitability framework, producing harmonized solar, wind, hydro, and combined renewable indices to support policy formulation, investment prioritization, and donor-funded project design.

Objectives

Develop standardized solar, wind, and hydropower suitability maps for Nigeria

Generate state-level renewable energy indices using zonal statistics

Construct an integrated Combined Renewable Energy Index to support comparative planning

Deliver reproducible, open, GIS-ready outputs for government and development partners

Methodology (Summary)

The project applies a GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework using satellite-derived and global datasets. Continuous suitability rasters are normalized, classified, and aggregated at state level. A combined renewable index is produced using normalized solar, wind, and hydropower indices.

Outputs

Continuous and classified suitability maps (solar, wind, hydro)

State-level zonal statistics (CSV)

Combined renewable energy ranking

Publication-ready charts and GIS layers

Expected Impact

Improved spatial targeting of renewable energy investments

Evidence-based support for Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan

Decision support for World Bank, AfDB, and climate finance programs
