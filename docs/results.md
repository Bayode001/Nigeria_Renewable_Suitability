3. Results
3.1 Continuous Suitability Surfaces

Continuous suitability indices were successfully generated for solar, wind, and hydropower across Nigeria using the standardized weighted overlay framework described in Section 2. All indices were normalized to a 0–1 scale prior to classification.

The resulting raster surfaces show clear spatial differentiation across ecological and climatic zones. Northern Nigeria consistently exhibits higher suitability for solar and wind energy, while hydropower suitability is concentrated along major river systems and high-flow catchments, particularly within the Middle Belt and southern regions.

3.2 Classified Suitability Patterns

Each continuous suitability raster was classified into five ordinal categories: Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High.

Solar suitability shows a dominance of High and Very High classes across arid and semi-arid northern states, reflecting favorable irradiance conditions.

Wind suitability presents a more spatially selective pattern, with optimal classes concentrated in parts of the North-West and North-East.

Hydropower suitability is more localized, driven by flow accumulation and slope constraints, with high suitability largely confined to river corridors and selected high-relief zones.

These classified maps form the basis for subsequent zonal and ranking analyses.

3.3 State-Level Zonal Statistics

Zonal statistics were computed at the state (ADM1) level using classified suitability rasters. For each state, the proportion of land area falling within each suitability class was calculated.

For solar energy, several northern states show a high percentage of land classified as High or Very High. For example, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Kebbi, Gombe, and Bauchi record substantial shares of highly suitable solar pixels, resulting in elevated solar suitability indices.

Hydropower zonal statistics reveal a contrasting spatial pattern. States with extensive river networks and favorable terrain record higher hydropower indices, while arid northern states generally exhibit lower hydropower suitability.

Wind zonal statistics further highlight regional variability, with a smaller subset of states achieving consistently high wind suitability scores.

3.4 Renewable-Specific Suitability Indices

For each energy type, a composite state-level index was derived by weighting the percentage of High and Very High suitability classes.

The solar index shows relatively high values across many states, indicating broad national potential.

The wind index is more unevenly distributed, reflecting the localized nature of wind resource suitability.

The hydropower index exhibits the greatest spatial concentration and the lowest national mean, underscoring its dependence on hydrological and topographic conditions.

These indices provide a comparable, interpretable measure of suitability at the policy-relevant administrative scale.

3.5 Combined Renewable Energy Index

A combined renewable energy index was constructed by normalizing and aggregating the solar, wind, and hydropower indices for each state.

The combined index reveals a clear ranking pattern. States such as Zamfara, Sokoto, Katsina, Yobe, and Gombe rank highest overall, driven primarily by strong solar and wind suitability, despite relatively lower hydropower potential. Conversely, states with strong hydropower resources but weaker solar or wind suitability achieve moderate combined rankings.

This result highlights the importance of multi-resource integration, as no single energy source dominates suitability across all regions.

3.6 Spatial and Policy-Relevant Implications

The combined suitability analysis demonstrates that Nigeria’s renewable energy potential is spatially heterogeneous and resource-dependent. Northern states emerge as strong candidates for solar–wind hybrid development, while central and southern regions present opportunities for hydropower-led or diversified portfolios.

The state-level rankings and accompanying visualizations provide an evidence-based foundation for strategic renewable energy planning, infrastructure prioritization, and regional investment targeting.
