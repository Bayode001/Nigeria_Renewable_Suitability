# Methodology – Renewable Energy Suitability Analysis (Nigeria)

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the methodological steps for solar, wind, and hydropower suitability assessment across Nigeria, using a standardized GIS workflow.

---

## 2. Data Sources
| Dataset | Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| DEM | NASA SRTM | 30m resolution |
| Solar GHI | Global Solar Atlas | Annual GHI |
| Wind Speed | Global Wind Atlas | 100m hub height |
| Land Cover | ESA WorldCover | 10m resolution |
| Rivers/Hydro | HydroSHEDS | Flow accumulation |
| Roads | OpenStreetMap | Road network |
| Grid Network | WRI GEP | Transmission lines |

---

## 3. Preprocessing Steps
- Reproject to common CRS  
- Clip to Nigeria boundary  
- Resample to common resolution  
- Reclassify using suitability rules  
- Normalize values 0–1  

---

## 4. Suitability Rules
Define scoring tables for solar, wind, hydro, and exclusion zones.

---

## 5. Weighted Overlay Model
Use either:  
- **AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)**  
- **Equal weighting**  
- **Expert weighting**

Final suitability:

```
S = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + w3*x3 + ...
```

---

## 6. Outputs
- Suitability raster  
- Classified suitability  
- Candidate site polygons  
- Printable maps  

---

## 7. Limitations
    Document assumptions, gaps, and uncertainties.
